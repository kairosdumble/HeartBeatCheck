# HeartBeatCheck
This healthcare project utilizes an ESP32 and AD8232 front-end circuit to acquire ECG signals, which are streamed to a React Native application. The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset is employed to train the AI model and to compare against real-time sensor measurements for arrhythmia detection.
